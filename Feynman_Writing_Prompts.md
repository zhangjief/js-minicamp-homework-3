1. Objects: Objects are like dictionaries. In a dictionary, if you know a word and want to get its meaning, you can just look it up in the dictionary. In objects, we also have pairs of keys and values. So you can look something up by its key and get back its value. The value can be a function. 

2. Properties: Properties are the values associated with an object. It has a name (the key mentioned above) and a vaule associated with it. 

3. Methods: Methods are properties of an object that are functions. You can creat a method by adding a new key to the object, and the value of the new key should be a function. 

4. For in loop: the for ... in loop interates over all the properties of an object. It is like if you have a bag of items, you want to go through all the items one by one, you can do "for (item in bag) {...} " to get information for each of the items in your bag.

5. dot notation vs bracket notation: there are two different ways to access properties of object. One is the dot notation, object.property. The other is called bracket notation, object['property']. They will provide the same results.
